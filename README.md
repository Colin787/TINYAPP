# TINYAPP
This is my very large app. My code was originally very jumbled and unorganized so I left early 
friday and completley refactored my code. I decided to add my functions in a seperate file just to please my brain.
Hope you enjoy! 

ps. I by accident stayed on my feature/user-registration branch and made all my commits there.. After some playing around
I managed to make master the master it should have been originally... Working on the other branch first probably was
for the best anyways.
